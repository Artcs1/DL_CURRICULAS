These three objectives are organized around the three horizons that make up the main intention of our course: the modern scientific horizon, the socio-political horizon and the artistic horizon. From this triple horizon we will expose, dialogue and participate in the reconstruction of the imaginary and the modern mentality, whose contributions and multiple developments constitute and still impact our contemporary imaginary. Indeed, it is not possible for us to interpret our actuality and its consequences if it is not based on the social, scientific and artistic products projected from modernity. The course is not only limited to historical review; In addition, it offers an essential component in any historical understanding: the analysis and revision of the limits and scope of modernity.
